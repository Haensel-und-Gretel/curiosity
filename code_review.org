#+title: Code Review


* March 20, 2021
** Behaviour Learner
   - Bring the behaviour learner up-to-date w/ current learner api.
   - Clean up what a behaviour update looks like. Where do we store the discount? How do we figure out the rewards? etc...
     
** Intrinsic rewards
   - Bring up-to-date with new learner api.
   - Use references to our advantage.
   - Does this need to be mutable?
   - What does the api need to look like? What are the other IRs that we will investigate?
     
** Learning Updates
   - Get update state implemented, so we can track parts of the update for debugging.
   - Clean up some of the old learning updates
     
** Experiment Utilities
   - Constructing learners and learning updates.
   - Separate required vs not-required
   - Logger could use some work, a bit complicated and scary right now, but likely usable.
